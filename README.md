# AndroidSpaceShips
A simple Android game that I worked on with a friend during the summer of 2015.

It uses the Gradle build tool and libGdx game library, and also works on a pc.
The easiest way to try it out is to go to the project root directory and type
'''bash
cd desktop
gradle run
'''

# Gameplay
The game starts in the "planning mode". Your ship is the left one. You can set
shooting orders by clicking anywhere on the screen.  If you click and drag from
your ship, you will set a move order.

When you're ready, click the "State button" (it should read "planning") or
press the space bar. The orders you have set should execute.  You can go back
to the planning stage whenever you want.

# gitinspector
The root directory also contains the file gitinspector_info.html, which details
project responsibilities and other repository information.
