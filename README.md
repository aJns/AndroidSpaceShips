# AndroidSpaceShips
A simple Android game that I worked on with a friend during the summer of 2015.

It uses the Gradle build tool and libGdx game library, and also works on a pc.
The easiest way to try it out is to go to the project root directory and type
'''bash
gradle run
'''

# gitinspector
The root directory also contains the file gitinspector_info.html, which details
project responsibilities and other repository information.
